# SfSL_Alexithymia_Analysis
This folder contains the code used for an analysis of SfSL/PISA intervention published in the journal Crisis.

The research is entitled, "Alexithymia in People with Recurrent Suicide Attempts: A niche area for targeted treatment" and was authored by Yvonne Bergmans, Tim Guimond, Clare Lambert, Shane McInerney and Kristen O'Brien. It is currently accepted for publication and this README file will be updated with issue and volume information (along with the code) once a publication date is determined.

Questions about the code can be directed to Tim Guimond at tim(dot)guimond(at)utoronto(dot)ca.
